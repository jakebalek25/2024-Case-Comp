# Case Competition
2024 Diamond Dollars Case Competition hosted by the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR)

# Group Members
Nathan Backman, Hunter Geise, Danielle Naperski, Nolan Pittman

# Case Problem
The prompt focused on the value of foul balls. Are certain foul ball locations, pitches, situations, etc. better than others? The prompt wanted students to create a metric to show the value of a foul ball defining a hitter or pitcher advantage. 

# Shiny App
Created by Jake Balek, our team merged the FOPA metric into a shiny app to display to judges and audience in a fun and interactive way. It can be found in the code or at: https://jjbalek.shinyapps.io/Case_Comp_Shiny_App/
